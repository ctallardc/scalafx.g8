Giter8 ScalaFX Template 
=======================

[SBT][sbt]/[Giter8][giter8] template for creating [ScalaFX](http://scalafx.org) projects.

The project you create using this template will have all preconfigured Scala and ScalaFX dependencies. 

Prerequisite
============
You need following things to use this template

* [SBT][sbt] (v.0.13.13 or newer) or [Giter8][giter8]
* Any one of Scala IDE (Eclipse / Netbeans / Intellij )

Usage
=====
If you have SBT v.0.13.13 or newer you can generate new project using command line command:

    $ sbt new scalafx/scalafx.g8

alternatively you can use Gitter8 to do the same:

    $ g8 scalafx/scalafx.g8

InteliJ IDEA and NetBeans can load directly the generated SBT project. 
If you are using Eclipse you can generate project configuration from SBT using command

    > eclipse
